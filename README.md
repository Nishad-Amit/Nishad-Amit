<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Amit Nishad</h1>

<p>
  I am a focused full-stack developer with a strong foundation in frontend design and development. I also have experience writing backend applications. My expertise includes both Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 development.
</p>

<p>
  While my primary focus has been on frontend development to date, I have actively expanded my skillset into other areas of web development, including backend, Web 3.0, and UI/UX Design. In addition to development, I possess skills in requirement gathering, time estimation, storytelling, and strong leadership.
